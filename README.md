## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a portfolio using HTML and CSS. 
There are several motives behind this project. It marks the implementation of  HTML and CSS and allows one to understand how to uniquely create their own portfolio showcasing the beginning of their front-end development skills. 

The main objective of this challenge is to demonstrate the fundamental comprehension of HTML and CSS along with showcasing deployed projects you have created.  

## User Story
AS AN employer

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to 
sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
